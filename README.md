# Project-1
I had to create a public main function separately for the informed topics that we were told to compile and run.
I added the flag variable to wether indicate if the variable is true or false in order to implement it along with my math function
Boolean and if-else statements were needed in order to confirm that if I had a variable besides what I'm supposed to get it still runs through the whole function.
I had to set the num -128 greater while the num to be bigger than 127 to set up for the rest of my program
I created separate integers for comps 1, comp 2, excess 128, BintoDec, DecToBin. 
I also added the magnitude, complement, and some notations.
Lastly, I added the scanner and print statements for all the topics listed for what we're expecting output from and also and if-else for whether the choice of answers differs as well.
